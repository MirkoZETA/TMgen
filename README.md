# TMgen: Traffic Matrix generation tool

TMgen is a tool for generating spatial, temporal, and spacio-temporal traffic matrices.
Generation is based on the Max Entropy model described in
**Spatiotemporal Traffic Matrix Synthesis** by Paul Tune and Matthew Roughan, published in ACM SIGCOMM 2015.

## Supported TM models

[x] Gravity Model
[x] Modulated Gravity Model (MGM)
[] Non-stationary Conditionally Independent Model (NCIM)
[] Log-normal Model
[] Poisson

## Usage

## Big Thanks
To Paul Tune, Matthew Roughan, and Ari Pakman for their work in this space and for making their code available.
This code is an adaptation of their Matlab versions [MaxEnt](https://github.com/ptuls/MaxEntTM) and
